# Basic HTML5 Page with CSS Styling and Contact Form

This project is a simple HTML5 web page demonstrating core web development concepts: semantic HTML, CSS styling, and a basic contact form.

## Features

- **Semantic HTML5 structure**
- **Custom CSS styling:**
  - Light blue-gray background for the page
  - Deep blue color for the main heading (`<h1>`)
  - Styled form with padding, rounded corners, and hover effects
- **Image display** using a placeholder image
- **Contact form** with required Name and Email fields

## How to Use

1. **Download or copy** the `index.html` file from this repository.
2. **Open** `index.html` in any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).
3. **View** the styled page, image, and contact form.
4. **Fill out** the form and click **Submit** (note: with the current setup, the form does not send data anywhere).

## Customization

- Change the background or heading color by editing the CSS in the `<style>` section.
- Replace the sample image URL with your own image.
- Modify form fields or add new ones as needed.
- To make the form functional, set the `action` attribute to your server endpoint or use a form handler.
